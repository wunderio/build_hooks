## Build hooks drupal module

13 Feb 2019: At the moment this module is a heavily modified version of the [Build hooks](https://www.drupal.org/project/build_hooks) module in drupal.org).
The plan is to integrate this version in the official one, but for now this lives in this github repository.

### Description and use case

This module is meant to be used in cases where Drupal is used as a content repository for one or more frontend sites.
The typical use case is for Gatsby sites powered by the [Gatsby Drupal source plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-drupal/): in this type of setup Drupal holds the content and a separate Gatsby site is built using the Drupal installation as the content source.

This module mainly provides privileged users with a UI to:

- Trigger deployments of the connected static site(s) at will
- View a log of the content that has been created, modified or deleted since the last deployment, by environment.

#### Installation and configuration

1. Install the module as usual
1. Visit the path `/admin/config/build_hooks/settings` and select the types of entities that you want to include in the log. For example: content (nodes), media entities, etc. As a general rule, it makes sense to select here the entities that are used in the static front end site. (For example, logging changes to user entities is probably not required, but this varies depending on your setup).
(at the present time, some of the settings here are not functional: *disregard the Triggers and Messages section because builds are not triggered at cron time or during entity creation* ) (@TODO: Cleanup or adapt those functions)
1. (optional) If you want to connect to CircleCI environments, enable the `build_hooks_circleci` module, and insert your CircleCI api key at the page: `/admin/config/build_hooks_circleci/buildhookscircleciconfig`
(PLEASE NOTE:) in context where the site configuration is committed to git, consider instead getting that value from environment variables so that you don't commit confidential information to git, for example adding something like this to your `settings.php`:
    ```
    $config['build_hooks_circleci.circleCiConfig']['circleci_api_key'] = getenv('YOUR_ENV_VAR_HERE');
    ```
1. Go to `/admin/structure/frontend_environment` and add one or more frontend environments, filling the required data for each. You can choose the type of environment, depending on the plugin types defined in your site.
1. The toolbar now should show your environments (clear cache if not visible) @TODO: Clear toolbar cache on plugin creation
1. Edit, delete or create entities of the types you have selected in step 1: you should see the counter next to each environment in the toolbar increment.
1. When ready to trigger a deployment, click on the toolbar item for the environment, and you will be taken to a page where you will see the changelog and a button to trigger the deployment.

#### Environment types

The `build_hooks` base module comes with a "Generic" environment type.
The `build_hooks_circleci` submodule provides an environment type for Circle CI.

Environments are defined as configuration entities supported by plugins: check the `build_hooks_circleci` for an example of how you can create your own frontend environment type.
